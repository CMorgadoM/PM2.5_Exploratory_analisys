# PM2.5_Exploratory_analisys
this repository contains code to fulfill the requirements to the 2nd course project of the Exploratory Data Analysis Course at Coursera

This repo contains 12 files, 6 plots and the codes to generate each one of these.
The main idea of this was to practice the ability to manipulate data and plot it
in a clear way. For accomplish that I have used the dplyr and ggplot2 packages and
the R base ploting system.

the files contains:
Plot1.png and Plot1.R: Shows the evolution of the total PM2.5 emissions in the USA
between 1999 and 2008.

Plot2.png and Plot2.R: Shows the variation of the PM2.5 emissions in the city of
Baltimore.

Plot3.png and Plot3.R: Illustrate the trend and the total emissions of PM2.5 in the
USA grouped by type of source.

Plot4.png and Plot4.R: Emissions from coal-related sources between 1999 and 2008.

Plot5.png and Plot5.R: Evolution of emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore
city between 1999 and 2008.

Plot6.png and Plot5.R: Compares the emissions from motor vehicle sources of
Baltimore and Los Angeles.

Finally some improvement I've learned for future plots.
    -Adjust the size of the png file, because some plots are shown cut off
    -The function arrangeGrob could be very useful for make graphics 
    with different scales.
